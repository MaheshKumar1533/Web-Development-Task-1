				<h2>Mercury</h2>
				<img src="Images/Mercury.jpeg" alt="Mercury" srcset="" />
				<ul>
					<li>
						Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and is also the
						smallest planet in our solar system.
					</li>
					<li>
						It has a thin atmosphere and experiences extreme
						temperature variations, with scorching hot days and
						freezing cold nights.
					</li>
					<li>
						Its surface is covered in craters, and it lacks
						significant geological activity.
					</li>
					<li>
						Mercury has been visited by the MESSENGER spacecraft,
						which provided valuable insights into its composition
						and geology.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2>Venus</h2>
				<img src="Images/Venus.jpeg" alt="Venus" />
				<ul>
					<li>
						Venus is often called Earth's "sister planet" due to its
						similar size and composition, but it has a thick, toxic
						atmosphere.
					</li>
					<li>
						The atmosphere traps heat through a greenhouse effect,
						making it the hottest planet in our solar system, even
						hotter than Mercury.
					</li>
					<li>
						Its surface is rocky and has vast volcanic plains,
						highland regions, and impact craters.
					</li>
					<li>
						The planet has been explored by various spacecraft,
						including the Soviet Venera probes and NASA's Magellan
						mission.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2>Earth</h2>
				<img src="Images/Earth.jpeg" alt="Earth" />
				<ul>
					<li>
						Earth is the only known planet with life, featuring a
						diverse range of ecosystems and environments.
					</li>
					<li>
						It has a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere that supports
						various life forms and moderates the climate.
					</li>
					<li>
						Surface features include oceans, continents, mountains,
						and diverse landscapes.
					</li>
					<li>
						Earth's moon, the Moon, is a natural satellite that has
						played a crucial role in Earth's history and
						exploration.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2>Mars</h2>
				<img src="Images/Mars.jpeg" alt="Mars" />
				<ul>
					<li>
						Mars is often called the "Red Planet" due to its reddish
						appearance, caused by iron oxide on its surface.
					</li>
					<li>
						It has polar ice caps, and evidence suggests that liquid
						water might exist beneath its surface.
					</li>
					<li>
						Mars has the largest volcano (Olympus Mons) and the
						deepest canyon (Valles Marineris) in the solar system.
					</li>
					<li>
						Rovers like Spirit, Opportunity, and Curiosity have
						provided valuable data about Mars' geology and potential
						habitability.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2>Jupiter</h2>
				<img src="Images/Jupiter.jpeg" alt="Jupiter" />
				<ul>
					<li>
						Jupiter is the largest planet and a gas giant composed
						mainly of hydrogen and helium.
					</li>
					<li>
						It has a strong magnetic field and a prominent feature
						called the Great Red Spot, a massive storm.
					</li>
					<li>
						Jupiter has a large number of moons, including the four
						Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.
					</li>
					<li>
						The Juno spacecraft has been studying Jupiter's
						composition, gravity field, magnetic field, and polar
						magnetosphere.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2>Saturn</h2>
				<img src="Images/Saturn.jpeg" alt="Saturn" />
				<ul>
					<li>
						Saturn is famous for its stunning ring system, composed
						of ice particles and rocky debris.
					</li>
					<li>
						It is a gas giant like Jupiter and has a slightly
						smaller size.
					</li>
					<li>
						Saturn's moon Titan has a thick atmosphere and liquid
						methane lakes, making it an interesting target for
						study.
					</li>
					<li>
						The Cassini-Huygens mission provided detailed
						information about Saturn's rings, moons, and atmosphere.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2>Uranus</h2>
				<img src="Images/Uranus.jpeg" alt="Uranus" />
				<ul>
					<li>
						Uranus is unique for its "sideways" rotation, with its
						axis tilted almost 90 degrees.
					</li>
					<li>
						It has a bluish tint due to its methane-rich atmosphere.
					</li>
					<li>
						Uranus has a faint ring system and numerous small moons.
					</li>
					<li>
						Voyager 2 provided the most comprehensive data on Uranus
						during its flyby in 1986.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2>Neptune</h2>
				<img src="Images/Neptune.jpeg" alt="Neptune" />
				<ul>
					<li>
						Neptune is the farthest planet from the Sun and is known
						for its vibrant blue color.
					</li>
					<li>
						It has strong winds and a storm called the Great Dark
						Spot, similar to Jupiter's Great Red Spot.
					</li>
					<li>
						Neptune's largest moon, Triton, has a retrograde orbit
						and a geologically active surface.
					</li>
					<li>
						Voyager 2 also visited Neptune and provided insights
						into its atmosphere and moons.
					</li>
